PLG_SYSTEM_REDIRECTTAMGHSVS="Redirect lazy links (PLG_SYSTEM_REDIRECTTAMGHSVS)"
PLG_SYSTEM_REDIRECTTAMGHSVS_XML_DESCRIPTION="Joomla system plugin. Redirects links that only consist of an article ID (example: 'href=\"2956\"'), which Joomla is redirecting to a 404 error page since version 4. This plugin is for lazy people who have a lot of such links on the website and do not want to search/rewrite all of them (which would be the recommendation for performance reasons)."
